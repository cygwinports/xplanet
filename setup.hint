sdesc: "Renders image of planets to X window"
ldesc: "Xplanet was inspired by Xearth, which renders an image of the 
earth into the X root window. All of the major planets and most 
satellites can be drawn, similar to the Solar System Simulator. A number 
of different map projections are also supported, including azimuthal, 
Lambert, Mercator, Mollweide, orthographic, and rectangular."
